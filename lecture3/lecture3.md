 and [Natural Earth's state/province boundaries](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/50m-admin-1-states-provinces/) 


Copy the URL for the states/provinces data from Natural Earth [on this page](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/50m-admin-1-states-provinces/), and connect the data set to Carto. We'll use this later.




## Spatial queries
PostGIS supports [an extensive set](https://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.4/reference.html#Spatial_Relationships_Measurements) of queries around spatial relationships and processing. For example:

* ST_Intersects (true/false), ST_Intersection (returns the intersection geometry)
* ST_Within (true/false)
* ST_Length
* ST_Touches (true/false)

Let's use some of these to make a map of stream station count by state using the Natural Earth data.

Start by doing a spatial intersection, to get the state/province each station is in.

```sql
SELECT stream.staname, prov.gn_name
FROM realstx AS stream, ne_50m_admin_1_states_provinces AS prov
WHERE ST_Intersects(stream.the_geom, prov.the_geom)
```

Now get aggregate statistics for each state.

* How many stations are there in California? Which state has the most stations?

```sql
SELECT prov.gn_name, count(*)
FROM realstx AS stream, ne_50m_admin_1_states_provinces AS prov
WHERE ST_Intersects(stream.the_geom, prov.the_geom)
	AND prov.gn_name = 'California'
GROUP BY prov.gn_name
```

Create a map of the number of stations by state. Color each polygon by the station count, and add labels and a legend.

```sql
SELECT prov.the_geom_webmercator, prov.cartodb_id, prov.gn_name, count(*),
FROM realstx AS stream, ne_50m_admin_1_states_provinces AS prov
WHERE ST_Intersects(stream.the_geom, prov.the_geom)
GROUP BY prov.the_geom_webmercator, prov.cartodb_id, prov.gn_name
```

FYI `cartodb_id` is not strictly necessary, but it is if you want an interactive map. Carto uses it to support popups and whatnot.

Also, if you're using a `GROUP BY` aggregator, all of the columns in the output (aside from the aggregation like `COUNT`) must be included as part of the `GROUP BY` statement. This is why `the_geom_webmercator`, `cartodb_id`, and `gn_name` appear in the `GROUP BY` clause.

We will review and extend our fluency in SQL.  We will use the readily available data through the data library, and then, next, we will incorporate external data sources.  First, though, here are the answers to the assignment:

### Assignment answers

Just about everyone was able to create and style the web map. If you have any further questions, please send me a note!  For the second part ofthe assignment, write your query in the editor to collect the closest 5 earthquakes to USF's campus.  Be sure that you **clear the query** after you finish, just in case you mistakenly link the map to this particular view.  

```sql
SELECT
  mag, latitude, longitude,
  ST_Distance(
    the_geom::geography, 
    CDB_LatLng(37.776429,-122.451287)::geography
  ) / 1000 AS dist
FROM 
  all_day
ORDER BY 
  dist ASC
LIMIT
  5
```

Paste the query after `https://<your_user_name>.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=`.  When you paste this into the browser, you should see the correct result. Note that you can submit the human-readable or the URL-encoded link for full credit, although the first one looks nicer:

```bash
https://dangeorge.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT mag, latitude, longitude, ST_Distance( the_geom::geography, CDB_LatLng(37.776429,-122.451287)::geography ) / 1000 AS dist FROM all_day order by dist asc limit 5
```

```bash
https://dangeorge.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT%20mag,%20latitude,%20longitude,%20ST_Distance(%20the_geom::geography,%20CDB_LatLng(37.776429,-122.451287)::geography%20)%20/%201000%20AS%20dist%20FROM%20all_day%20order%20by%20dist%20asc%20limit%205
```

#### Filter values based on attributes in a separate table

Suppose that we want to filter our data based on data from *two separate tables* with possibly *two separate geometry types*.  For example, how do we filter the USGS earthquakes for *just* those within the United States (as opposed to just zooming into the US for the assignment)?  This section will progressively write a query to select points within a polygon.

- Connect the world map of borders through the Data Library. Search for "borders" and you should see two options for world borders. The low-resolution option is sufficient.

- Return to your Datasets pane and connect the near real-time USGS earthquake data through the Data Library. (Search for `earthquakes` and you'll see one matching result.) The table name is `all_day`. The variable names should, roughly, match the columns in Assignment 1.

- Filter the earthquakes in `all_day` to just those within the United States.  
  - We need to refer to two tables in the same query. Experiment with the following two queries. What do they do?
  ```sql
  SELECT
    points.*
  FROM 
    all_day as points, world_borders as polygons
  ```
  ```sql
  SELECT
    polygons.*
  FROM 
    all_day as points, world_borders as polygons
  ```
  - We are only interested in the geometries in the `polygons` layer, where `name = 'United States'`.  Without a proper prefix, however, the column `name` may be ambiguous.
  ```sql
  WHERE
    polygons.name = 'United States'
  ```
  - Finally, we need only the `points` that are contained in the new polygon layer -- with a single geometry of the United States.  For this, we use the PostGIS function [`ST_Contains`](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Contains.html).  What happens if you reverse the arguments inside `ST_Contains()`.
  ```sql
  AND
    ST_Contains(
      polygons.the_geom, points.the_geom
    )
  ```
  - Assemble the previous components into a single query and preview the query result.  You don't need to create a map.
  ```sql
  SELECT  
      points.*
  FROM
      all_day as points, world_borders as polygons
  WHERE 
      polygons.name = 'United States'
  AND
      ST_Contains(
        polygons.the_geom, points.the_geom
      )
  ```

- Note that adding conditions or analysis to the query is pretty easy.  The fixed, up-front process of writing the query is tough.  Add a line to show only those earthquakes with a magnitute greater than 2.0.
```sql
SELECT  
    points.*
FROM
    all_day as points, world_borders as polygons
WHERE 
    polygons.name = 'United States'
AND
    ST_Contains(
    	polygons.the_geom, points.the_geom
    )
AND 
    points.mag > 2.0
```

- Another question: Why is [`ST_Contains`](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Contains.html) in the PostGIS documentation rather than the standard SQL documentation, like [`IN`](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp)? 

#### Filter values based on spatial relationship to elements in another table

- Connect the world airports dataset `ne_10m_airports`.  How many airports are in this dataset?  Count using SQL.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ne_10m_airports
```

- Find all airports that experienced an earthquake within 50 miles in the past day (read: whatever is in the `all_day` dataset).  Use the [`ST_DWithin`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DWithin.html) function.  Note that the function requires the distance in meters, so you'll have to use `50 * 1609` as the distance argument (i.e., the number of meters in 50 miles).  Be sure, also, to ensure that you are working with the [web mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator) projection by using the `the_geom_webmercator` variable. 
```sql

SELECT
  airports.*
FROM
  ne_10m_airports AS airports, 
  all_day AS earthquakes
WHERE
  ST_DWithin(
    airports.the_geom_webmercator,
    earthquakes.the_geom_webmercator,
    50*1609
  )
```

- What happens if you use `the_geom` rather than `the_geom_webmercator`? Why does that happen?

- Create a URL that displays **only the number of airports** in JSON.  Name the variable `num_airports`.
```
https://dangeorge.carto.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT count(airports.the_geom) as num_airports FROM ne_10m_airports as airports, all_day as earthquakes WHERE ST_DWithin( airports.the_geom_webmercator, earthquakes.the_geom_webmercator, 1609 * 50 )
```

- Now we can work on the visualization.  Create a map from the filtered airports, which are near earthquakes.  Add a layer of the full earthquakes dataset.  Style the map and zoom into southern California.

##### Alternative query, for practice

- What is an alternative to the query that relies on [`ST_Within`](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Within.html)?  Adjust the query to replicate the results using [`ST_Buffer`](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Buffer.html) and [`ST_Intersects`](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Intersects.html).  This is hard.  
  - First, we need data from the two tables. Call and appropriately name the tables.
  ```sql
  FROM
    ne_10m_airports AS airports, 
    all_day AS earthquakes
  ```
  - Next, we need to buffer the airports.  This creates a new geometry on the fly, which we can then use with the [`ST_Contains`](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Contains.html) function.
  ```sql
  ST_Buffer(
    airports.the_geom_webmercator,
    50*1609
  )
  ```
  - Filter the earthquakes to those within the newly minted layer.  
  ```sql
  WHERE
    ST_Intersects(
      ST_Buffer(
        airports.the_geom_webmercator,
        50*1609
      ),
      earthquakes.the_geom_webmercator
    )
  ```
  - Assemble the query from the components above (and other components not yet written):
  ```sql
  SELECT
    airports.the_geom_webmercator,
    airports.cartodb_id
  FROM
    ne_10m_airports AS airports, 
    all_day AS earthquakes
  WHERE
  ST_Intersects(
    ST_Buffer(
      airports.the_geom_webmercator,
      50*1609
    ),
    earthquakes.the_geom_webmercator
  )
  ```

##### Quick GROUPing lesson

A common operation in data science is to collapse tabular data into group averages, counts, minimums, maximums, and other reduction operations.  What is the largest earthquake by country?  How many airports are in each state?  We group these events by a repeated attribute, like country or state.  We will learn, briefly in this lecture, how to use the [`GROUP BY`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp) statement to collapse data.

*Practice example 1.*

  - Connect the dataset of congressional districts (as of 2015) using the data library.  The data set is called `congressional_districts_2015`.
  - Refer to the documentation of [`GROUP BY`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp) and display the top five states with the largest number of districts.  Display just the count and state name.
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    statename, COUNT(*) 
  FROM 
    congressional_districts_2015
  GROUP BY 
    statename
  ORDER BY
    count DESC
  LIMIT
    5
  ```

*Practice example 2.*

  - Connect the dataset of populated places, `ne_10m_populated_places_simple`.
  - Count the number of populated places in each country.  Display just the count and country name.
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    adm0name, COUNT(*) 
  FROM 
    ne_10m_populated_places_simple
  GROUP BY 
    adm0name
  ORDER BY
    count DESC
  ```
  - Find the largest populated place in each country, as listed in the dataset.  Use the `MAX` function.
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    adm0name, MAX(pop_min) 
  FROM 
    ne_10m_populated_places_simple
  GROUP BY 
    adm0name
  ORDER BY
    max DESC
  ```

#### Assignment 2

Using the Property Land Use Tax lot Output (PLUTO) data table entitled `mnmappluto` in the CartoDB data library, along with the associated [data dictionary](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf), answer the following questions:
  1. How many tax lots are there in Manhattan?  How much area does this cover?
  2. Show the growth of the city.  Post a map that colors the tax properties by the year they were built in roughly 20 year increments (from 1900 through the present). How many lots in Manhattan are owned by New York University? What is their average number of floors?
  3. Write a query that calculates the minimum distance between each lot and public spaces (defined as `landuse = '09'`). Only calculate this for those tax lots with `cartodb_id < 50`. This is hard.  Please submit your best guess if you are unable to figure it out.
